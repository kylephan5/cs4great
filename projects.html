                    chronically homeless in dignity and helps many move into long-term, month-to-month housing. The
                    project focuses on designing a website from the ground up using Google Sites to help spread
                    Motels4Now's mission with the community and raise support for their cause.

                    <b>About the Project: </b>The Council on Aging of Elkhart County (COA) is a non-profit organization
                    dedicated to supporting senior citizens by providing life-giving services. They provide free
                    transportation, social activities, financial assistance, and in-home medical care. One of their
                    newer services is a collection of contacts for nearby resources that can help these individuals.
                    Previously, seniors had to call the COA phone number and an employee either read off the appropriate
                    results by filtering an Excel spreadsheet or sent screenshots back over email. This process was
                    becoming cumbersome and inefficient for COA, so they reached out to CS for Good and asked for a
                    modification to their website that would allow for this process to be automated. Since then, we have
                    added a new page to their website for the “Resource Library” using Squarespace, Airtable, HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript. It includes a form that the seniors can fill out with a category and optional
                    filters for the query. Upon submission, the senior can either see the results in the web browser or
                    print out the result table. The results of this addition have been overwhelmingly positive with a
                    30% increase in traffic to the website as a whole. In addition, the Resource Library page has become
                    the second most popular page on the website, behind only the home page, and has the lowest bounce
                    rate of any page. The Council on Aging of Elkhart County is doing great work for the seniors in the
                    local community and this modification will continue to help them reach a larger and broader
                    audience.

                    The goal of our project is to build websites for local nonprofits who are in need of a simple,
                    modern website. This project requires extensive use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For CSS, we are
                    using the modern responsive design library Bootstrap. Currently, we are working on a project with
                    Near Northwest Neighborhood, Inc., and are excited to get to the finish line later this semester!

                class about Internet Safety and Communication to senior citizens in the South Bend area. The class
                provides them with information on how to stay safe from scams and fake information as well as keeps them
                updated on the newest technologies for staying connected with others online. We also help students after
                class with their own technology issues and questions. For each of the classes we decide the topics and
                activities and create slides on Canva. The group teaches once a week in person at the Forever Learning
                Institute in South Bend.
